# Data Acquisition Service Documentation

## Overview
The Data Acquisition service implements step 1 of the arbitrage strategy, providing a robust system for aggregating price data from multiple sources with comprehensive error handling, validation, and monitoring.

## Features

### Price Feed Aggregation
- Distributed price feed collection from multiple sources
- Confidence scoring based on data quality and latency
- Weighted median calculation for reliable price determination
- Minimum required sources (3) for price validation

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling protocol with severity levels:
  - PRICE_FEED_TIMEOUT (MEDIUM severity)
  - INSUFFICIENT_DATA (LOW severity)
  - NETWORK_CONGESTION (MEDIUM severity)
  - VALIDATION_ERROR (HIGH severity)
- Retry strategies with exponential backoff
- Error rate monitoring with configurable thresholds

### Caching Strategy
- Redis-based caching implementation
- Configurable TTLs for different data types:
  - Price data: 30 seconds
  - Liquidity data: 60 seconds
  - Volume data: 300 seconds
- LRU eviction policy for cache management

### Performance Monitoring
- Latency tracking for all operations
- Warning threshold: 200ms
- Critical threshold: 500ms
- Error rate monitoring:
  - Warning threshold: 1%
  - Critical threshold: 5%

### Data Sources
1. Uniswap API
   - Real-time price data
   - Liquidity information
   - Confidence scoring based on response quality

2. Sushiswap API
   - Price feed integration
   - Volume data
   - Latency monitoring

3. The Graph
   - Historical data access
   - Aggregated metrics
   - Query-based data retrieval

4. On-chain Data
   - Direct blockchain queries
   - Highest confidence scoring
   - Real-time state verification

## Implementation Details

### PriceFeed Class
```typescript
interface PriceFeed {
    source: string;
    timestamp: number;
    price: bigint;
    confidence: number;
    latency: number;
}
```

### PriceAggregator Class
- Manages multiple price feeds
- Implements weighted median calculation
- Handles cache operations
- Monitors system health

### Error Handling Strategy
```typescript
const ERROR_HANDLING_STRATEGY = {
    PRICE_FEED_TIMEOUT: {
        maxRetries: 3,
        backoffMs: 1000,
        escalation: 'MEDIUM'
    },
    // ... other error types
};
```

## Usage Examples

### Adding a Price Feed
```javascript
await priceAggregator.addPriceFeed(
    tokenAddress,
    'uniswap',
    price,
    confidence
);
```

### Getting Aggregated Price
```javascript
const price = await priceAggregator.getAggregatedPrice(tokenAddress);
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Health Checks
- Regular latency monitoring
- Error rate tracking
- Cache performance metrics
- Data source availability

### Alerts
- Critical latency notifications
- Error rate threshold alerts
