# Error Code and Handling Strategy Mapping

This document maps the error codes defined in `plans/technical-specifications.md` to the error handling strategies outlined in `docs/data-acquisition.md`. It provides a comprehensive view of how different types of errors are handled across the system.

## Error Code Mapping

### PRICE_FEED_TIMEOUT
- **Severity:** MEDIUM
- **Max Retries:** 3
- **Backoff Time:** 1000ms (1 second)
- **Handling Strategy:**
  - Implement exponential backoff retry mechanism
  - Monitor latency and error rates
  - Alert if threshold exceeded (Warning: 200ms, Critical: 500ms)
  - Fallback to alternative price feeds if available

### INSUFFICIENT_LIQUIDITY
- **Severity:** LOW
- **Max Retries:** 0
- **Backoff Time:** 0ms
- **Handling Strategy:**
  - Skip current trading opportunity
  - Log event for monitoring
  - Continue monitoring for new opportunities
  - No retry attempt as insufficient liquidity requires market change

### EXECUTION_FAILED
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Max Retries:** 2
- **Backoff Time:** 2000ms (2 seconds)
- **Handling Strategy:**
  - Validate transaction parameters
  - Check gas prices and network conditions
  - Implement circuit breaker if multiple failures
  - Alert operations team for investigation

### NETWORK_CONGESTION
- **Severity:** MEDIUM
- **Max Retries:** 5
- **Backoff Time:** 5000ms (5 seconds)
- **Handling Strategy:**
  - Implement exponential backoff
  - Monitor network conditions
  - Adjust gas prices if necessary
  - Consider alternative networks if available

## Additional Error Types from Data Acquisition

### INSUFFICIENT_DATA
- **Severity:** LOW
- **Handling Strategy:**
  - Wait for more data sources
  - Log warning for monitoring
  - Continue with available data if minimum sources met
  - Alert if persistent across multiple intervals

### VALIDATION_ERROR
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Handling Strategy:**
  - Reject invalid data
  - Log error details
  - Alert for immediate investigation
  - Verify data source integrity

## Error Handling Implementation

### Monitoring and Alerting
- Track error rates and patterns
- Set up alerts based on severity levels
- Monitor retry attempts and success rates
- Track latency for all operations

### Recovery Procedures
1. Automatic Recovery
   - Implement retry mechanisms with backoff
   - Use circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures
   - Fallback to alternative data sources

2. Manual Intervention
   - Define escalation procedures
   - Document recovery steps
   - Maintain incident response playbooks

### Error Prevention
- Implement input validation
- Monitor system health metrics
- Regular system maintenance
- Proactive capacity planning

## Integration with System Components

### Price Feed Service
- Implement all error handling strategies
- Monitor feed health and latency
- Maintain multiple data sources
- Regular health checks

### Arbitrage Engine
- Handle errors gracefully
- Implement profit verification
- Monitor gas costs
- Track execution success rate

### Transaction Service
- Monitor network conditions
- Handle transaction failures
- Implement gas price strategy
- Track transaction status
