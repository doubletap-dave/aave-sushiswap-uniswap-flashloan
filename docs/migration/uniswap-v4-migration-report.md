- Position management optimization
- MEV protection capabilities

### Flash Accounting Integration
The new flash accounting system provides:
- More efficient capital utilization
- Reduced gas costs for flash operations
- Native support for complex swap patterns
- Enhanced arbitrage opportunities

## 3. Security Considerations

### Implemented Security Measures

- ⏳ External audit (pending)

## 4. Performance Improvements

### Gas Optimization
| Operation | Before (V2/V3) | After (V4) | Improvement |
|-----------|---------------|------------|-------------|
| Pool Creation | ~3M gas | ~500K gas | ~83% reduction |
| Swap Execution | ~150K gas | ~100K gas | ~33% reduction |
| Flash Operations | ~200K gas | ~120K gas | ~40% reduction |
