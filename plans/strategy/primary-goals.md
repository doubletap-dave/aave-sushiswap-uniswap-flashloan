   - Without profit-generating logic, tests will revert
   - Mock contracts can't fully simulate flash loan mechanics

2. Alternative Testing Approaches:
   - Unit Tests (Current):
     * Basic contract functionality
     * Access control
     * Input validation
     * Event emission
   - Integration Tests:
     * Mock pool interactions
     * Basic token operations
     * Emergency controls
   - Mainnet Fork Tests (Recommended):
     * Use hardhat network fork of mainnet
     * Test with real AAVE contracts
     * Simulate actual flash loan mechanics
     * Implement temporary profit logic for testing
   - Testnet Testing:
     * Limited by asset availability
     * Use as final validation step
     * Focus on deployment and verification

3. Testing Strategy Updates:
   - Implement mainnet fork testing environment
   - Add profit-generating mock logic for tests
   - Test full flash loan cycle in forked environment
   - Use testnet for deployment verification only

### Detailed Testing Plan

This testing plan outlines the specific tests to be performed to ensure the functionality, security, and performance of the AAVE Flash Loan Arbitrage system. It aligns with the coverage targets defined in `plans/technical-specifications.md` and addresses the limitations of asset borrowing on Sepolia by prioritizing mainnet fork testing and implementing mock logic for tests.

#### 1. Unit Tests

*   **Objective:** Verify the correct implementation of individual contract functions.
*   **Scope:**
    *   Contract functions: Ensure each function performs as expected under various input conditions.
    *   Access control: Validate that only authorized accounts can perform privileged actions.
    *   Input validation: Confirm that the contract correctly handles invalid or malicious inputs.
    *   Event emission: Verify that events are emitted as expected when specific actions occur.
*   **Tools:** Hardhat, Mocha, Chai
*   **Metrics:** Code coverage, number of tests passed/failed

#### 2. Integration Tests

*   **Objective:** Verify the interaction between different components of the system.
*   **Scope:**
    *   Mock pool interactions: Simulate interactions with the AAVE lending pool using mock contracts.
    *   Token operations: Test the transfer and approval of tokens within the system.
    *   Emergency controls: Validate the functionality of emergency stop mechanisms.
*   **Tools:** Hardhat, Mocha, Chai, Mock contracts
*   **Metrics:** Number of tests passed/failed

#### 3. Mainnet Fork Tests

*   **Objective:** Simulate real-world conditions by testing the system on a fork of the Ethereum mainnet.
*   **Scope:**
    *   Full flash loan cycle: Test the entire process of borrowing assets, performing arbitrage, and repaying the loan.
    *   Profit simulation: Verify that the system can identify and execute profitable arbitrage opportunities.
    *   Gas optimization: Measure the gas cost of transactions and identify areas for optimization.
*   **Tools:** Hardhat, Mainnet fork, Real AAVE contracts
*   **Metrics:** Profit generated, gas cost, number of transactions executed

#### 4. Testnet Validation

*   **Objective:** Verify the deployment and basic functionality of the system on the Sepolia testnet.
*   **Scope:**
    *   Deployment verification: Confirm that the contract is deployed correctly on the Sepolia network.
    *   Contract interaction: Test basic interactions with the deployed contract.
    *   System monitoring: Monitor the system for errors and performance issues.
*   **Tools:** Hardhat, Sepolia testnet, Block explorer
*   **Metrics:** Deployment success, contract interaction success, system uptime

#### Addressing Sepolia Limitations

Due to the limitations of asset borrowing on Sepolia, the following strategies will be employed:

*   **Prioritize Mainnet Fork Testing:** Focus on mainnet fork testing to simulate real-world conditions and ensure the system can handle flash loans with real assets.
*   **Implement Mock Logic for Tests:** Use mock contracts to simulate the behavior of the AAVE lending pool and other external components in unit and integration tests.
