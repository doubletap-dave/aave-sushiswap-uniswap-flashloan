## Project Plan for AAVE Flash Loan Arbitrage App

Below is a step-by-step plan that an AI agent (or any developer) can follow to build a simple AAVE flash loan–based arbitrage application. The goal is to compare prices across multiple DEXs (initially Uniswap and Sushiswap) and execute arbitrage when profitable. The plan also outlines best practices for Solidity contract development, Node.js scripting, and integration on the Sepolia testnet using Alchemy.

---

### 1. Project Setup & Dependencies

1. **Initialize the Project Directory**  
   - Create a new folder for your project (e.g., `flash-loan-arb`).
   - Inside the project folder, initialize a `npm` or `yarn` package:
     ```bash
     npm init -y
     # or
     yarn init -y
     ```
2. **Directory Structure**  
   Organize your project as follows:
   ```
   flash-loan-arb
   ├── contracts
   │   └── FlashLoanArb.sol
   ├── index.js
   ├── package.json
   ├── .env
   └── ...
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**  
   - **Solidity/Hardhat or Truffle** (for contract compilation/deployment).
   - **ethers** (for interaction with Ethereum in the Node.js script).
   - **dotenv** (to securely load private keys, Alchemy URLs, etc.).
   - **@uniswap/sdk**, **@sushiswap/sdk** (to query DEX prices and handle trades).
   - **commander** (or **yargs**) for a simple CLI interface.
   - **@openzeppelin/contracts** (for ERC20 interactions).

   Example:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev hardhat
   npm install --save ethers dotenv @uniswap/sdk @sushiswap/sdk commander @openzeppelin/contracts
   ```
4. **Create a `.env` File**  
   - Store sensitive information (like Alchemy API keys, private keys, contract addresses).  
   - Example variables:
     ```plaintext
     ALCHEMY_API_URL_SEPOLIA="https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_API_KEY"
     PRIVATE_KEY="0xyourprivatekey"
     FLASH_LOAN_ARB_CONTRACT="0xYourDeployedArbContract"
     POOL_ADDRESS="0xAavePoolContractOnSepolia"
     TOKEN_TO_BORROW="0xTokenAddress" # e.g. WETH or DAI on Sepolia
     ```
   - **Never** commit the `.env` file to source control.

---

### 2. Contract Development

1. **Create the Flash Loan Contract**  
   - File: `contracts/FlashLoanArb.sol`
   - Use AAVE’s flash loan interface (e.g., `IPool` for Aave V3).
   - Implement a function `executeOperation()` to handle the logic after receiving the flash loan.
   - Make sure to approve the repayment (`IERC20(asset).approve()`) to return the `amount + premium`.

2. **Best Practices**  
   - Use **OpenZeppelin**’s implementation of `IERC20` for safety.
   - Only allow the owner to trigger flash loans or withdraw leftover tokens.
   - Plan for reentrancy protection if needed (e.g., `ReentrancyGuard`), though for a minimal example it might not be strictly required.
   - Ensure your compiler settings in Hardhat config (`hardhat.config.js`) match your Solidity version (e.g., `pragma solidity ^0.8.17;`).

3. **Compile & Test the Contract**  
   - Use Hardhat to compile the contract:
     ```bash
     npx hardhat compile
     ```
   - Write preliminary tests in `test/FlashLoanArb.js` (or `.ts` if using TypeScript) to confirm compilation and basic functionality:
     - Contract deploys without error.
     - `owner` can call `startFlashLoan()`.
     - `executeOperation()` is triggered.

---

### 3. Deployment on Sepolia

1. **Configure Hardhat**  
   - In `hardhat.config.js`:
     ```js
     require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox");
     require("dotenv").config();

     module.exports = {
       networks: {
         sepolia: {
           url: process.env.ALCHEMY_API_URL_SEPOLIA,
           accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY]
         }
       },
       solidity: "0.8.17"
     };
     ```
2. **Deploy the Contract**  
   - Create a deploy script (e.g., `scripts/deploy.js`):
     ```js
     const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

     async function main() {
       const poolAddress = process.env.POOL_ADDRESS;
       const tokenToBorrow = process.env.TOKEN_TO_BORROW;

       const FlashLoanArb = await ethers.getContractFactory("FlashLoanArb");
       const flashLoanArb = await FlashLoanArb.deploy(poolAddress, tokenToBorrow);

       await flashLoanArb.deployed();
       console.log("FlashLoanArb deployed to:", flashLoanArb.address);
     }

     main().catch((error) => {
       console.error(error);
       process.exitCode = 1;
     });
     ```
   - Deploy:
     ```bash
     npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
     ```
3. **Update `.env`**  
   - Copy the deployed contract address into your `.env` variable `FLASH_LOAN_ARB_CONTRACT`.

---

### 4. Node.js CLI Script

1. **Create `index.js`**  
   - Purpose:  
     1. Load environment variables (Alchemy URL, private key, contract address).  
     2. Compare prices on Uniswap & Sushiswap.  
     3. If profitable, call your deployed contract to borrow flash loans.  
     4. Provide a CLI (e.g., `node index.js check-prices`, `node index.js run-arb`, etc.).
2. **Structure**  
   - Use **commander** for CLI options and commands:
     ```js
     const { Command } = require("commander");
     const program = new Command();

     program
       .command("check-prices")
       // ...
       .action(async (opts) => { /* ... */ });

     program
       .command("run-arb")
       // ...
       .action(async (opts) => { /* ... */ });

     program.parse(process.argv);
     ```
3. **Price Fetching**  
   - Integrate with Uniswap / Sushiswap SDK to fetch real prices.  
   - Create helper functions like `fetchPriceUniswap(token, base)` and `fetchPriceSushiswap(token, base)`.
   - **Best Practice**: For reliability, consider using official subgraphs or oracles to cross-check prices if needed.
4. **Arbitrage Logic**  
   - Compare the two prices from Uniswap & Sushiswap.  
   - If difference > some threshold (enough to cover gas + premium), call `startFlashLoan` on your contract with the desired flash loan amount.  
   - Pack any parameters in `bytes _params` if needed (e.g., instructions on which DEX to buy on and which DEX to sell on).
5. **Testing**  
   - Initially test with small amounts on Sepolia.  
   - Verify transaction success or any revert reasons.  
   - Gradually increase the complexity of your price-checking logic.

### 5. Arbitrage Execution Flow

1. **User Initiates**  
   - E.g., `node index.js run-arb -t 0xTokenAddress -a 100000000`.  
2. **Node Script**  
   - Compares prices from Uniswap & Sushiswap.  
   - If profitable, calls `contract.startFlashLoan(flashAmount, params)`.
3. **Flash Loan Contract**  
   - Receives borrowed tokens from Aave.  
   - Executes trades:  
     - Swap borrowed tokens on DEX1 -> obtains second token.  
     - Immediately swap second token on DEX2 -> obtains more of the original token.  
   - Repays `amount + premium` to Aave.  
   - Any leftover profit remains in the contract or can be transferred to the owner.
4. **Result**  
   - If success, user can withdraw tokens (profit) from contract using the `withdrawToken()` function.  

---

### 6. Security & Best Practices

1. **Security Checks**  
   - Use `require` statements to ensure only the contract owner can call the flash loan function.  
   - Validate user inputs in the Node script and the contract to prevent accidental large losses or malicious usage.  
2. **Gas Optimization**  
   - Use **Solidity 0.8.17** with [compiler optimizations in Hardhat config](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/guides/compile#configuring-solidity-compilation).  
   - Minimize external calls and keep logic efficient.  
3. **Testing on a Local Fork**  
   - For deeper testing, fork mainnet or a testnet in Hardhat.  
   - Simulate real conditions (e.g., real liquidity, real price feeds).  
4. **Audit**  
   - For production-level usage, consider a formal audit of the contract code.

---

### 7. Future Enhancements

1. **Add More DEXs**  
   - Support Balancer, Curve, or other liquidity sources for potential arbitrage.  
2. **Advanced Price Feeds**  
   - Integrate real-time oracles (e.g., Chainlink) or subgraph data for more accurate pricing.  
3. **Automated Execution**  
   - Instead of user-initiated CLI, set up a cron job or script that periodically checks for opportunities.  
   - Use a keeper/bot solution to handle on-chain triggers automatically.  
4. **Multichain**  
   - Consider bridging strategies if cross-chain arbitrage is possible.

## Summary

1. **Set Up Environment & Install Dependencies.**  
2. **Develop & Compile `FlashLoanArb.sol`.**  
3. **Deploy to Sepolia & Update `.env` with Addresses.**  
4. **Build a Node.js CLI (`index.js`)** for:  
   - Checking prices on Uniswap & Sushiswap.  
   - Executing flash loan arbitrage if profitable.  
   - Withdrawing leftover tokens.  
5. **Test Thoroughly** on Sepolia with small amounts.  
6. **Refine & Iterate** with additional DEXs, improved price feeds, and possibly automation.

With this plan, an AI agent (or any developer) should be able to methodically build, deploy, and test an AAVE flash loan arbitrage app, using best practices for both Solidity and Node.js.
